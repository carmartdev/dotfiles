# dotfiles
My dotfiles on Fedora Linux with Wayland &amp; Hyprland
- No bull$hit
- No anime girl
- No distracting or performance consuming fancy things
- just a simple setup that works ( at least for me;) )


# To Use:
Just clone it, Copy everything into .config and your good to go
  ```sh
	git clone https://github.com/carmartdev/dotfiles.git
	cd dotfiles
	cp -r * ~/.config
  ```

# Bindings:
- Opening Firefox `S-w`
- Opening Emacs `S-z`
- Others are just Hyprland defaults

# Sources:
I don't remember just searched simple hyprland example and then edited it until it looked like what I want.
